# WebRTC
This is a new alternative video transfer mode available for Raspberry Pi 4 users with an HDMI-CSI bridge.
It uses H.264 encoding instead of MJPEG and provides significantly less traffic consumption.

# How to use
If you use an OS image built after 2021.06.10, this mode will be available to you by default.
If you are upgrading to an older version of the OS, you will need to manually enable the WebRTC gateway:
```
# systemctl enable --now kvmd-janus
```
Then restart the Web UI and then in the **System** menu you will see the video mode switch.

# Subtleties
The MJPEG video stream uses the same HTTP connection that you use to download the web interface.
This means that for remote access, you just need to forward ports 80 and 443 on your router.

In contrast, WebRTC is a completely different way of transmitting video.
It uses a P2P connection and UDP. This reduces network load, but makes it difficult to configure
- the server needs to know your network configuration in order to use it correctly.

To implement this, the Pi-KVM checks which of the network interfaces is used for the default gateway,
and also tries to find out your external address using the Google [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) server.
This is necessary when using [Tailscale](tailscale.md) or so that you can connect to your Pi-KVM from the external Internet,
since simply forwarding ports 80 and 443 for WebRTC is not enough - it requires a direct connection.

If you don't like using Google (it was chosen as the default for reliability reasons) for this purpose,
you can choose [any other STUN server](https://www.voip-info.org/stun/) at your discretion, or start your own.
Use `/etc/kvmd/override.yaml` to this:
```yaml
janus:
    stun:
        host: stun.stunprotocol.org
        port: 3478
```
And restart `systemctl restart kvmd-janus`.

# Custom Janus config
[Janus](https://janus.conf.meetecho.com) is a WebRTC gateway that is used to transmit the [uStreamer](https://github.com/pikvm/ustreamer) video.
KVMD-Janus is a wrapper around it, configuring and monitoring changes in the network configuration. This is suitable for most users.
However, if your Pi-KVM is not connected to the Internet and/or you want to use a custom Janus configuration,
then you should use the `kvmd-janus-static` service instead. You should first change the Janus configuration yourself.
You can find it in `/etc/kvmd/janus/janus.jcfg`.
```
# systemctl disable --now kvmd-janus
...
# systemctl enable --now kvmd-janus-static
```
